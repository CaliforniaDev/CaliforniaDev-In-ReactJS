      `As a skilled web developer, I built a 
      responsive e-commerce web application that can be 
      used on various devices. To improve delivery service, 
      I integrated the Google Maps API for map locations, 
      and added the Autocomplete feature for address input for 
      enhanced user experience.`,

      `To plan out the design, I created 
      low and high fidelity wire-frames using Adobe XD's 8pt grid system. 
      I also used vanilla JavaScript, ensuring the project was completed 
      without reliance on any libraries. This approach helped me to have 
      a better control and maintainability of the final solution.`,
